# Gnomes

Gnomes are the most intellectually and technologically advanced race of Pelagia. Combining long lives with a contempt for tradition and a burning desire for knowledge, gnomes rely on their sheer brilliance to survive the many dangers of their rugged jungle homeland.

## Appearance and physical attributes

Gnomes stand roughly three feet high. A typical adult gnome weighs between 35 and 45 pounds. Gnomish men and women differ little in height and weight, though gnomish men tend to be slightly heavier on average.

Before settling the grand Gnomish capital of [insert name], gnomes lived in tribal communities scattered throughout the jungle. Relying on camouflage and cleverness to survive, gnomes are adept at blending into their surroundings. Gnomes may present a variety of skin tones, from deep earthen brown to pale green or gold--mirroring the diverse flora of their jungle home. Hair colour is equally varied and exceptionally colourful. Gnomish hair tends to mimic the colours of indigenous flowers and birds, ranging from brilliant blue to fuschia, pale green, or even deep violet.

## Mental and cultural characteristics

Gnomes are brilliantly intelligent, by far the most intelligent race of Pelagia. Their tremendous intellect proves both help and hindrance. Gnomes are attracted to novelty above almost anything else. A new and exciting idea might prompt them to drop whatever they're working on, fully dedicating themselves to a new project even if they were mere moments from completing their previous one. Gnomish manuscripts--for gnomes are among a select few races with a rich written record--are dense and stylistically diverse. Even a straightforward manual might veer in many directions, even changing dialect partway through at the whim of the author. Gnomish dialects are practically as diverse as gnomes themselves: every gnomish writer applies their own idiosyncracies to the language. This constant and dramatic evolution of language is beloved by fellow gnomes, who adore the challenge of translating each work--or even each passage within a work--into language they understand. Other races of Pelagia find gnomish practically incomprehensible, whether spoken or written. This difficulty in translation helps gnomes preserve their technological supremacy. A typical human would struggle to grasp the most fundamental concepts of gnomish technology, let alone their byzantine language practices.

Gnomes are relatively friendly to outsiders. Trade with other regions is crucial to gnomish prosperity and the advancement of technology, so gnomes maintain open and peaceful diplomatic relations with all races. They are particularly close with nearby mountain dwarf clans. Where mountain dwarves excel at earthworks, mining, and rugged construction of all kinds, gnomes excel at metallurgy. Gnomes alone have mastered the art of producing steel from iron ore. Despite rarely using armor and weapons themselves, gnomish trade prospers by supplying fine steel armaments to dwarves, humans and other "big folk."
